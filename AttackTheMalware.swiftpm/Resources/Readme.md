### Info about the game
***
Attack The Malware is a mini game focused on the theme of cyber security. It is about a boy whose name is Frank. While he's approaching his computer, he notices an alert on the monitor. There was a breach in his computer's firewall! Frank begins to worry only to realize that the malware is a ransomware. This type of malware aims to encrypt all data on the machine he is infecting in order to demand a ransom for decryption. The user has to help Frank, and in particular his computer's firewall, to get rid of the malware.

### Info about the topic
***
The game, as previously mentioned, aims to raise awareness of the issue of cyber security. In fact, in this period we often hear about cyber attacks on companies or governments through the use, for example, of viruses, trojans, ransomware. They are all part of one big family: malware. There are many types of them, ranging from data encryption, to the cancellation of these, or to spy the user. Malware can infect a device in a variety of ways. A simple example is an attachment of an email considered reliable while instead, thanks perhaps to social engineering, it was created ad hoc in order to be trusted. In reality, this attachment will hide a malicious payload, the malware. So, be aware when surfing on the internet.

### Technologies
***
The game was developed thanks to SpriteKit and AVFoundation frameworks.
